Five Forces Model - Cork Industry

- Bargaining power of buyers: 
  - Worldwidem there are small wine producers, but there are very big wine producers with high bargaining power;
  - There are intermediaries (wholesalers) in international markets;
  - Amorim  created its network of own international distributors that deal directly with wine producers around the world;
- Bargaining power of suppliers: 
  - Small, dispersed farmers of cork trees (-);
  - Amorim has bought cork tree farms for their own production (-)
  - Still, the cork industry depends on cork and cannot rapidly expand cork production due to the time taken for cork trees to grow (+);
- Rivarly among competitors: 
  - For Amorim, the rivalry is low;
  - For the small cork producer companies, rivalry is very high;
- Threat of new entrants: 
  - The technology and investment needed to produce cork stoppers only is not very high;
  - The technology and investment eneded to produce othwe cork products is mainly high;
  - The networks of distributors and of own cork tree forms is a barrier for new entrants;
- Threat of substitutes: 
  - Plastic stoppers and aluminium stoppers have gained a market share, especially in low quality wine. Still, cork stoppers are prefered and associated with high quality wine;
